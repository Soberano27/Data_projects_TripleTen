# Zomato Restaurant Sales and Ratings Analysis

## Introduction

In this report, I delve into the intricate details of sales and customer ratings data for restaurants listed on Zomato, with a focus on the Indian marketplace. By harnessing the power of Tableau visualizations, I aim to decode the patterns and trends that contribute to the success of these businesses, offering insightful data to industry stakeholders.

## Objectives

My analysis is driven by:
- Analyze and interpret sales data across various cities and cuisines to understand market behavior.
- Investigate the relationship between customer ratings and sales figures.
- Pinpoint cuisines and locales that are key opportunities for business growth.

## Conclusion

The Zomato dataset analysis reveals that traditional Indian and Chinese dishes maintain their lead in the market, reflecting established consumer preferences. However, the success of Indian-Thai and American offerings illustrates the market's receptivity to emerging and diverse culinary experiences, even among less-reviewed establishments. Additionally, the relationship between review volume and sales is weak, suggesting other factors influence revenue. Sales trends also indicate a possible market recovery, moving upwards after a period of decline.
## Plans for Data Correction

I have noted a couple of discrepancies in my initial analysis that need to be addressed:

- **Clarifying Rating Counts**: I will refine my approach to ensure accurate representation of restaurants that may appear in both "10k+ Ratings" and "Too Few Ratings" categories.

- **Revising Average Rating Calculation**: I will modify the calculation of the average rating to more accurately reflect the true sentiment of customer feedback, by considering the rating in conjunction with the count of each rating.

I am committed to rectifying these issues and will release an updated version of the analysis upon completion of the review.

## Recommendations

Based on my findings, I suggest that restaurant owners and stakeholders on the Zomato platform:
- Look into the untapped potential in cities like Tirupati.
- Focus on enhancing offerings in popular cuisines such as Indian and Chinese
- Explore emerging trends like Indian-Thai fusion and American cuisine.
- Refine operational strategies in response to customer feedback and market trends.
